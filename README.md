# Data-Analytics-Projects

This repository contains my academic and practical data analytics projects, featuring work in Excel, Python, R, and Power BI. Each project includes datasets, analyses, and reports demonstrating data-driven insights and decision-making skills.

## Projects

- **Project 1 – R Analysis and Report**  
  Includes R scripts, visualizations, and a detailed report explaining data insights and interpretations.

- **Project 2 – Power BI Dashboard**  
  Features interactive dashboards analyzing Superstore Sales data with metrics like sales, profit, quantity, and discounts.  
  The results and visuals are available inside the Power BI file.

- **Project 3 – Excel Analysis**  
  Contains a full Excel-based data analysis project, including calculations, visualizations, and summarized findings in the same file.

- **Project 4 – Python Linear Regression (Baseball Performance Prediction)**  
  Uses Python’s scikit-learn to develop a linear regression model predicting the Oakland A’s 2002 baseball performance.  
  The analysis explores key variables such as runs scored and runs allowed to forecast wins and compares predictions with actual outcomes for insight into team performance.

- **Project 5 – Quantitative Analysis (Healthcare Data)**  
  Analyzes Medicare data to compare the annual percentage of Black and White enrollees with at least one ambulatory visit.  
  The study applies statistical methods in Excel to identify significant racial disparities in healthcare access and provides data-driven policy recommendations.

- **Project 6 – Pastas R Us: Business Performance Analysis**  
  This project analyzes sales and demographic data from 74 Pastas R Us restaurants to evaluate location selection criteria and the effectiveness of the loyalty card program.  
  Using Excel-based descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and visualization, the study explores factors influencing sales per square foot and sales growth.  
  The report concludes with data-driven recommendations for optimizing restaurant expansion and marketing strategies.

- **Project 7 – Alumni Giving Data Analysis**  
  This project investigates factors influencing alumni donations at a large university using Excel-based descriptive and predictive analytics. The analysis includes:  

  - Descriptive statistics summarizing graduation rate, class size, student/faculty ratio, and alumni giving rate.  
  - A simple linear regression predicting alumni giving rate based on graduation rate.  
  - A multiple linear regression model using graduation rate, % of classes under 20, and student/faculty ratio to predict alumni giving rate.  
  - Exploration of a quadratic term for graduation rate to improve prediction accuracy.  

  The project concludes with actionable recommendations for university administrators to increase alumni donations.

- **Project 8 – Real Estate Regression Analysis**  
  This project analyzes real estate data to explore the relationship between home square footage and listing price using Excel-based regression analysis. The study includes:  

  - Calculation of the line of best fit (regression equation) for predicting home prices based on square footage.  
  - Determination of the correlation coefficient (r) and interpretation of the strength and direction of the association.  
  - Examination of the slope and intercept to interpret pricing trends and estimate the value of land.  
  - Calculation and interpretation of the R-squared value to assess model fit.  

  The analysis provides actionable insights for D.M. Pan Real Estate Company to understand pricing trends and improve property valuation.
